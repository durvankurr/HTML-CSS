## Project- Spice Garden Restaurant

### Context

In today's digital age, establishing a strong online presence is essential for businesses, including restaurants. The Spice Garden Restaurant, a fictional establishment, currently lacks an effective and engaging online platform to connect with potential customers and showcase its unique culinary offerings. This poses a significant problem as it restricts the restaurant's ability to reach a broader audience and provide essential information to its patrons. The absence of a responsive website limits the restaurant's visibility and hinders its potential for growth in an increasingly competitive industry.

Additionally, it struggles to reach beyond its local audience, missing out on global patrons and the opportunity to foster customer loyalty and engagement. To address these challenges, the restaurant needs a comprehensive website that showcases its culinary offerings and enhances its online presence.

As a novice web developer, design and create a responsive website for the fictitious "Spice Garden Restaurant."  The website will serve as an online platform to showcase the restaurant's offerings, provide essential information to potential customers, and offer an engaging user experience.

### Problem Statement

Design a responsive web page for Spice Garden Restaurant, making it accessible to potential customers and enhancing its online visibility.
The website should be designed using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework to ensure responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes. The project will be divided into multiple sections, each catering to specific content and functionality.
